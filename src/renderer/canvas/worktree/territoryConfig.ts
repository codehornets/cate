// BRIDGES (an MST of center-to-center capsules linking nearby same-worktree
// panels, fading out with distance), rendered as a smooth gradient that fades
// outward, with a couple of thin crisp terrace-edge outlines on top. Static (no
// per-frame animation). Pure data — adjust the whole look here. Values target
