Cate is an Electron desktop app for arranging development tools in freeform space. Mix floating canvas panels with docked tabs and splits, detach panels into standalone windows, and keep multiple workspaces synced across sessions.

## Getting Started

Open any folder to create a workspace — Cate restores your canvas layout, panel positions, and open terminals every time you come back. Right-click the canvas to add panels, press `Cmd+K` for the command palette, or drag panels onto the dock to create tabs and splits.

No configuration files, no project setup — just point Cate at a directory and start working.

## Why Cate?

Alt-tab works fine — until you have 12 terminals, 6 files open, docs in another window, and notes scattered across desktops. At that point switching windows becomes the actual bottleneck.

Cate replaces that pile of windows with **one persistent canvas per project**. Terminals, editors, browsers, and notes sit where you put them, grouped how you think about them, and they're still there when you come back the next day.

> Cate is **not a window manager replacement**. Tiling/scrolling WMs (Hyprland, Niri, GlazeWM, KDE) are great if you mainly want to arrange OS windows. Cate is a spatial canvas around a single project's tools — closer to Figma's infinite canvas than to a WM.

## Features

### 🎨 Canvas & Layout

- **Infinite canvas** — zoom, pan, and arrange panels anywhere in freeform space. Pan with two-finger drag or right-click drag; zoom with `Cmd+scroll` or the canvas controls.
- **Dock system** — drag floating panels onto the dock to create tabs and splits. Each dock zone (center, left, right, bottom) can hold multiple tabs with type-colored icons.
- **Detached windows** — pull panels or full dock layouts into separate OS windows.
- **Saved layouts** — name, save, load, and delete canvas arrangements (nodes and regions) from an in-app modal (`Cmd+K → "Saved Layouts…"`).
- **Multi-workspace sessions** — keep several projects open and restore them on restart. Switch between workspaces from the sidebar.

### 💻 Code, Docs & Terminals

- **Monaco Editor panels** — full VS Code-grade editing with syntax highlighting, multi-cursor, find/replace, diff support, and Markdown Preview/Source mode with GFM rendering. Scratch editors persist unsaved content across sessions.
- **Persistent editor buffers** — file-backed models are reused across panels, and scratch editor content persists with the session.
- **Document panels** — native canvas viewers for PDFs, DOCX files, and images, with file type detection backed by magic-byte checks.
- **Native terminals** — xterm.js with WebGL rendering, backed by `node-pty` PTYs rooted in the active workspace. Shell auto-detection with graceful fallback if the configured shell is unavailable.
- **Browser panels** — embedded webview panels for previewing documentation, dev servers, or any URL. Context-isolated with hardened security settings.

### 🔧 Git & Source Control

- **Git-aware file explorer** — file tree with live filesystem watching, tracked/untracked dimming, search, and copy/paste for files and folders with collision-safe renaming.
- **Source control sidebar** — stage/unstage, branch management, worktrees, commit history, and inline diff views. Git monitor polls and surfaces changes automatically.
- **Project-wide search** — full-text search across workspace files with instant results.

### 🤖 AI Agent

- **Pi Agent panel** — run an in-app coding agent powered by `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`, with chat threads, per-chat model restore, and workspace-aware panel placement.
- **Provider auth & models** — connect OAuth providers such as Anthropic, OpenAI Codex, and GitHub Copilot, or API-key providers such as OpenAI, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, Groq, Mistral, DeepSeek, and more.
- **Marketplace & plan mode** — install Pi extensions from the marketplace and use Cate's bundled plan-mode helper for agent-guided implementation planning.

### 🔍 Search & Navigation

- **Canvas-wide search** (`Cmd+Shift+F`) — Spotlight-style overlay that searches workspace files, live terminal scrollback, and open panel titles/paths in one place. Recent-focus ranked results with colored type-tile icons.
- **Panel switcher** (`Ctrl+Space`) — compact keyboard overlay for jumping between open canvas panels and centering the selected node.
- **Command palette** (`Cmd+K`) — quick access to commands, open panels, and workspace files. Unified Spotlight-style chrome across all overlays.

### 🖥️ Desktop Polish

- **Auto-save & session restore** — all panel state, positions, and open files persist automatically.
- **Optional macOS native window tabs** — group Cate windows in the system tab bar.
- **Auto-update checks** — checks GitHub releases and notifies when a new version is available.
- **Crash resilience** — Sentry diagnostics, session restore validation, shell fallback banners in the PTY, and guarded update/restart flows help prevent noisy or looping crash states.

## Install

If you just want to use Cate, download a prebuilt release — don't build from source. This repository currently targets **v1.0.1**.

| Platform | Formats | Link |
|----------|---------|------|
| macOS | DMG, ZIP (`arm64`, `x64`) | [Latest release](https://github.com/0-AI-UG/cate/releases/latest) |
| Windows | NSIS installer, ZIP (`x64`) | [Latest release](https://github.com/0-AI-UG/cate/releases/latest) |
| Linux | AppImage, DEB, `tar.gz` (`x64`) | [Latest release](https://github.com/0-AI-UG/cate/releases/latest) |

> **macOS note:** release builds are notarized and configured for hardened runtime. Unsigned local or test builds may require:
> ```bash
> xattr -cr /Applications/Cate.app
> ```

> **Linux note:** on Steam Deck or other read-only-root distros, prefer the `tar.gz` portable build. If the AppImage fails to launch, try `--no-sandbox` as a fallback (e.g. `./Cate.AppImage --no-sandbox`).

## Build from Source

> The steps below are for **contributors** — use the prebuilt release above for daily use.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20 or 22 LTS (see `.nvmrc`). Node 23+ is not supported; `node-pty` has no prebuilds and native compilation will fail.
- npm >= 9
- Python 3 and a C++ compiler (for `node-pty` native module)
  - macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install build-essential python3`
  - Fedora/RHEL: `sudo dnf install @development-tools gcc-c++ make python3`
  - Arch: `sudo pacman -S base-devel python`
  - Windows: [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) (select the "Desktop development with C++" workload)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0-AI-UG/cate.git
cd cate
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the Electron app with hot reload via electron-vite.

### Quality Checks

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test            # unit tests (vitest)
npm run test:e2e    # Playwright integration tests
```

For the Electron smoke test harness:

```bash
npm run test:smoke:electron
```

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Package for Distribution

```bash
npm run package
# or target one platform:
npm run package:mac
npm run package:win
npm run package:linux
```

Packaged binaries will be in the `release/` directory.

## Security & Packaging

Cate uses a context-isolated preload bridge for all IPC communication. Filesystem access is scoped to registered workspace roots, browser panels use hardened webview settings with disabled node integration, and the updater falls back to opening the GitHub release page when a verified installer path is unavailable. Workspace-scoped `allowedRoots` validation prevents terminals from spawning outside approved directories.
